## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m an IT professional with **14+ years** of deep expertise in **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**, specializing as a **Solace PubSub+ Subject Matter Expert (SME)**. I design, build, and operate scalable, highly available messaging systems that power mission-critical data flows across cloud and on-premises environments.

Lead a globally distributed Site Reliability Engineering team focused on the design, deployment, and operational excellence of Solace PubSub+ messaging platforms supporting critical enterprise event-driven architectures.
